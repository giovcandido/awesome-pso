# pso-optimization
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm implemented with Python

## Instructions
In the optimization.py, change the function to be optimized to any function you wish.

Then, all you have to do is to execute the script. 

The script takes two arguments: (S) number of particles in the swarm and (M) maximum number of iterations.

Run as follows: python3 optimization.py --swarm-size S --max-iterations M.

If you run the script with the example function, 20 particles and 1000 iterations, the expected output is: x[0] = -1.0000 and x[1] = 8.9443.

Making it easier for you, run: python3 optimization.py --swarm-size 20 --max-iterations 1000. Check it out!
